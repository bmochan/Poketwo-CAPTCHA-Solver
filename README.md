# Poketwo-CAPTCHA-Solver
helper function for something bigger

as the name suggests, it is a captcha solver for poketwo. the code is pretty scuffed since i wrote it in only an hour so i am accepting constructive criticism.
one major flaw with this program is that it requires the opened chrome window to be the active window for solving the captcha (since it sends keystrokes)

plans for the future:
fix the flaw
introduce headless mode
